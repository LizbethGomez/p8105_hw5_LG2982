## Problem 1:

#### Data Import

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ──────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1     ✔ purrr   0.3.3
    ## ✔ tibble  2.1.3     ✔ dplyr   0.8.3
    ## ✔ tidyr   1.0.0     ✔ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✔ readr   1.3.1     ✔ forcats 0.4.0

    ## ── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(purrr)

set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

There are two cases to address:

For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the mean
of non-missing values For character variables, you should fill in
missing values with “virginica” Write a function that takes a vector as
an argument; replaces missing values using the rules defined above; and
returns the resulting vector. Apply this function to the columns of
iris\_with\_missing using a map statement

#### Function and Replacement

``` r
output <- vector("list", length = ncol(iris_with_missing))

na_replace <- function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
    
  }  else if (is.character(x)) {
    replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

output = map(iris_with_missing, na_replace)
```

## Problem 2:

#### Data Import

Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names
include the subject ID and arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time: - Start with a
dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help -
Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

``` r
file_names_df = tibble(
  file_names = list.files(path = "./data/Problem_1"))



read_data <- function(file_name) {
  
  read_csv(paste0("data/Problem_1/", file_name))
  
}


study_data_import = 
  file_names_df %>% 
  mutate(
    study_data = map(file_names_df[[1]], read_data))
```

#### Data Tidy

  - Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
    subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
    other tidying that’s necessary

<!-- end list -->

``` r
study_data_tidy = 
  study_data_import %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = observation, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  separate(file_names, into = c("study_arm", "subject_id"), sep = "\\_") %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = str_replace(subject_id, "\\.csv", ""),
    subject_id = str_remove(subject_id, "^0+"), 
    week = str_replace(week, "\\week_", ""), 
    study_arm = recode(study_arm, con = "Control", exp = "Experimental")) 
```

    ## Warning: `cols` is now required.
    ## Please use `cols = c(study_data)`

``` r
study_data_tidy
```

    ## # A tibble: 160 x 4
    ##    study_arm subject_id week  observation

#### Plot of participants’ observation over time

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time,
and comment on differences between group

``` r
study_data_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = subject_id, group = subject_id)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~study_arm) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations Over 8 Weeks", 
    x = "Week", 
    y = "Observation", 
    color = "Participant") + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

Comments: As shown by the graphs, the experimental arm in general has a
higher number of observation than the control.

## Problem 3:

First set the following design elements:

Fix n=30 Fix xi1 as draws from a standard Normal distribution Fix β0=2
Fix σ2=50 Set β1=0. Generate 10000 datasets from the model

``` r
set.seed(10)

sim_regression = function(beta1, n = 30, beta0 = 2, sd = 50^(.5)) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(n, mean = 0, 50^(.5))
  )
  
  fit_line = lm(y ~ x, data = sim_data) %>% broom::tidy() 
  
  tibble(
    b1_estimate = fit_line[[2,2]],
    p_value = fit_line[[2,5]]
  )
  
}
beta1_list = list("beta1_0" = 0, 
              "beta1_1" = 1,

              "beta1_5" = 5,
              "beta1_6" = 6
              )

  - Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected
    (the power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of β1 on
    the x axis. Describe the association between effect size and power.

<!-- end list -->

As shown in the plot above, as the true value of beta 1 increased the
power increases as well. There is a linear relationship between these
two.

  - Make a plot showing the average estimate of β̂ 1 on the y axis and
    the true value of β1 on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay
    on the first) the average estimate of β̂ 1 only in samples for which
    the null was rejected on the y axis and the true value of β1 on the
    x axis. Is the sample average of β̂ 1 across tests for which the
    null is rejected approximately equal to the true value of β1? Why or
    why not

there is a difference among these two betas because essentially, there
is a larger difference when the true value of beta 1 is small, as the
true value of beta 1 increases the difference between the two tests
becomes smaller.
