## Problem 1

#### Data Import

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.2.1     ✔ purrr   0.3.3
    ## ✔ tibble  2.1.3     ✔ dplyr   0.8.3
    ## ✔ tidyr   1.0.0     ✔ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✔ readr   1.3.1     ✔ forcats 0.4.0

    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(purrr)

set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

There are two cases to address:

For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the mean
of non-missing values For character variables, you should fill in
missing values with “virginica” Write a function that takes a vector as
an argument; replaces missing values using the rules defined above; and
returns the resulting vector. Apply this function to the columns of
iris\_with\_missing using a map statement

#### Function and Replacement

``` r
output <- vector("list", length = ncol(iris_with_missing))

na_replace <- function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
    
  }  else if (is.character(x)) {
    replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

output = map(iris_with_missing, na_replace)
```

## Problem 2:

#### Data Import

Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names
include the subject ID and arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time: - Start with a
dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help -
Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

``` r
file_names_df = tibble(
  file_names = list.files(path = "./data/Problem_1"))



read_data <- function(file_name) {
  
  read_csv(paste0("data/Problem_1/", file_name))
  
}


study_data_import = 
  file_names_df %>% 
  mutate(
    study_data = map(file_names_df[[1]], read_data))
```

#### Data Tidy

  - Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
    subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
    other tidying that’s necessary

<!-- end list -->

``` r
study_data_tidy = 
  study_data_import %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = observation, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  separate(file_names, into = c("study_arm", "subject_id"), sep = "\\_") %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = str_replace(subject_id, "\\.csv", ""),
    subject_id = str_remove(subject_id, "^0+"), 
    week = str_replace(week, "\\week_", ""), 
    study_arm = recode(study_arm, con = "Control", exp = "Experimental")) 
```

    ## Warning: `cols` is now required.
    ## Please use `cols = c(study_data)`

``` r
study_data_tidy
```

    ## # A tibble: 160 x 4
    ##    study_arm subject_id week  observation
    ##    <chr>     <chr>      <chr>       <dbl>
    ##  1 Control   1          1            0.2 
    ##  2 Control   2          1            1.13
    ##  3 Control   3          1            1.77
    ##  4 Control   4          1            1.04
    ##  5 Control   5          1            0.47
    ##  6 Control   6          1            2.37
    ##  7 Control   7          1            0.03
    ##  8 Control   8          1           -0.08
    ##  9 Control   9          1            0.08
    ## 10 Control   10         1            2.14
    ## # … with 150 more rows

#### Plot of participants’ observation over time

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time,
and comment on differences between group

``` r
study_data_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = subject_id, group = subject_id)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~study_arm) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations Over 8 Weeks", 
    x = "Week", 
    y = "Observation", 
    color = "Participant") + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

![](p8105_hw5_LG2982_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->
Comments: As shown by the graphs, the experimental arm in general has a
higher number of observation than the control.
