```

There are two cases to address:

For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the mean
of non-missing values For character variables, you should fill in
missing values with “virginica” Write a function that takes a vector as
an argument; replaces missing values using the rules defined above; and
returns the resulting vector. Apply this function to the columns of
iris\_with\_missing using a map statement

``` r
output <- vector("list", length = ncol(iris_with_missing))

na_replace <- function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
    
  }  else if (is.character(x)) {
    replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

output = map(iris_with_missing, na_replace)
```

Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names
include the subject ID and arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time: - Start with a
dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help -
Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

``` r
file_names_df = tibble(
  file_names = list.files(path = "./data/Problem_1"))

# function to read csv files

read_data <- function(file_name) {
  
  read_csv(paste0("data/Problem_1/", file_name))
  
}

# data frame with nested results from each file 
study_data_import = 
  file_names_df %>% 
  mutate(
    study_data = map(file_names_df[[1]], read_data))

  - Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
    subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
    other tidying that’s necessary

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time,
and comment on differences between group
